Goal:
Use the provided functions to apply concrete tags to a transcribed voice memo or suggest new tags for improving categorization.

Inputs:
- Transcribed memo text
- YAML-formatted list of existing tags

Outputs:

Output as many function calls as you feel is needed to tag the memo.
Suggest tags as needed, as long as the tags are reasonably broad and fit into best-practice categorization/organization schemes.
